# Functional Programming, Information Systems, Summer 2023-2024

## Algorithm for solving exercises

    1. What is the name of the procedure/function?
    2. How many parameters does it take?
    3. What is the type of the parameters?
    4. What are the names of the parameters?
    5. What is the return type?
    6. Break the task into smaller tasks. List them.

## Do not be afraid to ask questions

> ðŸ“Œ If you are struggling a lot with the tasks, don't hesitate to ask us for a `1-1 session` in-person or via Google Meet ðŸ˜‡!

and remember:

> He who asks a question is a fool for five minutes; he who does not ask a question remains a fool `forever`.

-Chinese Proverb

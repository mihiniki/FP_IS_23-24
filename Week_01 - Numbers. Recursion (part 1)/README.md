### üì¢ Advice

The tasks have the sole purpose of helping you understand the material better and faster. Therefore:

1. Avoid using external tools or help for solving the tasks.
2. Drop us an email with your question/problem when you have difficulties.
3. If you can't solve a task:
   1. Spend at least 30 minutes trying out different ways to achieve what you want - maybe try to break down the task into smaller tasks and create functions that solve them.
   2. Solving a task manually with pen and paper will help you break it down into smaller tasks.
   3. If the above points don't help, it's best to reach out to us, skip this task and continue with the others. This would allow you to continue solving, while you're waiting for feedback from us.
4. If you are struggling a lot with the tasks, don't hesitate to ask us for a `1-1 session` in-person or via Google Meet üòá!

### ‚≠ê Task 6

**Description:**

The greatest common divisor (`GCD`) of two or more numbers is the greatest common factor that divides them, exactly. For example, the greatest common factor of `15` and `10` is `5`, since both the numbers can be divided by `5` and there is no number larger than `5` that divides `15` and `10`, thus `GCD(15, 10) = 5`.

One way to find the greatest common divisor between two numbers - `x` and `y` is by using `The Euclidean Algorithm`.

```text
The Euclidean Algorithm for finding GCD(x,y) is as follows:
If x = 0 then GCD(x,y)=y.
If y = 0 then GCD(x,y)=x.
Write x in quotient remainder form (x = A‚ãÖy + R). Find GCD(y,R) (since GCD(x,y)=GCD(y,R)).
```

Define two functions - `myGcdG` and `myGcdPM`, for calculating the `GCD` of two whole numbers.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. Add one new test case. Place a comment after it with the words `my test`.
2. All tests pass.
3. Normally, you would use the built-in function `gcd`. This is the only time when you should **not** use it.
4. The types of the parameters match the description.
5. Both functions implement `The Euclidean Algorithm` as outlined in the description.
6. `myGcdG` is implemented using guards.
7. `myGcdPM` is implemented using patten matching.

**Test cases:**

```haskell
print $ myGcdG 5 13 == 1
print $ myGcdG 13 1235 == 13

print $ myGcdPM 5 13 == 1
print $ myGcdPM 13 1235 == 13
```

### ‚≠ê Task 7

**Description:**

A leap year is a calendar year that contains an additional day compared to a common year. The 366th day is added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical year or seasonal year.

There are two mathematically equivalent methods for checking whether a year is a leap year.

```text
Method I: A year is leap year if it is a multiple of 400 or it is a multiple of 4 but not of 100.

Method II:
    if year is divisible by 400 then is_leap_year
    else if year is divisible by 100 then not_leap_year
    else if year is divisible by 4 then is_leap_year
    else not_leap_year 
```

Define two predicates - `isLeapYearOneLine` and `isLeapYearGuards`, that check whether a year is a leap year.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. Add one new test case. Place a comment after it with the words `my test`.
2. All tests pass.
3. Parameter validation is performed.
4. `isLeapYearOneLine` implements `Method I`.
5. `isLeapYearOneLine` uses boolean logical operators.
6. `isLeapYearOneLine` does not return `True` or `False` explicitly.
7. `isLeapYearGuards` uses guards.

print $ isLeapYearOneLine 1988 == True
print $ isLeapYearOneLine 1600 == True
print $ isLeapYearOneLine 2400 == True
print $ isLeapYearOneLine 2023 == False
print $ isLeapYearOneLine 1700 == False
print $ isLeapYearOneLine 1800 == False
print $ isLeapYearOneLine 2100 == False

print $ isLeapYearGuards 2020 == True
print $ isLeapYearGuards 1988 == True
print $ isLeapYearGuards 1600 == True
print $ isLeapYearGuards 2400 == True
print $ isLeapYearGuards 2023 == False
print $ isLeapYearGuards 1700 == False
print $ isLeapYearGuards 1800 == False
print $ isLeapYearGuards 2100 == False

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. Add one new test case. Place a comment after it with the words `my test`.
2. All tests pass.
3. Guards are used.
4. Parameter validation is performed.
5. The types of the parameters match the description.

print $ canCarry 42 95.11 0.51 == "Yes"
```

### ‚≠ê Task 9

**Description:**

Each **day** a plant is growing by *upSpeed* meters. Each **night** that plant's height decreases by *downSpeed* meters due to the lack of sunlight. Initially, plant is 0 meters tall. We plant the seed at the beginning of a day. We want to know when the height of the plant will reach a certain level.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. Add one new test case. Place a comment after it with the words `my test`.
2. All tests pass.
3. The parameters are named in accordance with the names given in the fourth test case.

**Test cases:**

```haskell
print $ growingPlant 5 2 5 == 1
print $ growingPlant 5 2 6 == 2
print $ growingPlant 10 9 4 == 1
print $ growingPlant 100 10 910 == 10 -- upSpeed=100, downSpeed=10, desiredHeight=910
```

- for `upSpeed = 10`, `downSpeed = 9` and `desiredHeight = 4`, the output should be `1`.

```text
Because the plant reaches the desired height at day 1 (10 meters).
After day 1 --> 10
```

- for `upSpeed = 100`, `downSpeed = 10` and `desiredHeight = 910`, the output should be `10`.

```text
After day 1   --> 100
After night 1 --> 90
After day 2   --> 190
After night 2 --> 180
After day 3   --> 280
After night 3 --> 270
After day 4   --> 370
After night 4 --> 360
After day 5   --> 460
After night 5 --> 450
After day 6   --> 550
After night 6 --> 540
After day 7   --> 640
After night 7 --> 630
After day 8   --> 730
After night 8 --> 720
After day 9   --> 820
After night 9 --> 810
After day 10  --> 910
```

### ‚≠ê Task 10

**Description:**

A snail crawls up a column. During the day it crawls up some distance. During the night it sleeps, so it slides down for some distance (less than it crawls up during the day).

Your function accepts three parameters:

- The height of the column (meters);
- The distance that the snail crawls during the day (meters);
- The distance that the snail slides down during the night (meters).

Calculate the number of days the snail will need to reach the top of the column.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. Add one new test case. Place a comment after it with the words `my test`.
2. All tests pass.

**Test cases:**

```haskell
print $ snail 3 2 1 == 2
print $ snail 10 3 1 == 5
print $ snail 10 3 2 == 8
print $ snail 100 20 5 == 7
print $ snail 5 10 3 == 1

### üí´ Task 11

```

### üí´ Task 12

**Description:**

Define a function that takes as inputs your potential grades on homeworks and exams and outputs your final grade for this subject. If the final grade is less than `2`, return `2`.

Here is the formula:

```text
O = 1/2 TK + 1/4 IT + 1/4 IZ
```

where

```text
TK = 1/4 D + 3/8 KT + 3/8 KZ

and

D is the average grade from 3 homeworks;
KT is the average grade from 2 theory exams;
KZ is the average grade from 2 practice exams;
IT is the grade from the theory final;
IZ is the grade from the practice final.
```

Note that:

- `0` is a possible grade and means that the student did not submit their assignment.
- if a student has KZ >= 4,50 and **on each** practical exam has KZ<sub>i</sub> >= 4,00, then they don't go to the final on the practice part as that is enough to form the final grade without taking the actual final. That means that IZ = KZ.
- if a student has KT >= 4,50 and **on each** theory exam has KT<sub>i</sub> >= 4,00, then they don't go to the final on the theory part as that is enough to form the final grade without taking the actual final. That means that IT = KT.

Assume the order of the inputs is the following:

`D1 D2 D3 KZ1 KZ2 KT1 KT2 IZ IT`

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. Add one new test case. Place a comment after it with the words `my test`.
2. All tests pass.
3. The result is rounded to the second digit after the decimal point.

**Test cases:**

```haskell
print $ finalGrade 3 4 4 4.25 4.50 3.75 4.25 5 4.25 == 4.34
print $ finalGrade 6 6 6 4.50 5 4.50 4.75 5 4.75    == 4.95
print $ finalGrade 6 0 4 6 6 5 4.75 6 4.75          == 5.14
print $ finalGrade 4.25 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0             == 2
print $ finalGrade 5.50 6 6 6 5.50 5.25 4 5.50 4    == 5.05
print $ finalGrade 6 6 6 5.50 5.50 4 5 5.50 5       == 5.25
print $ finalGrade 6 6 6 5.25 6 4 4 5.63 3.50       == 4.84
```

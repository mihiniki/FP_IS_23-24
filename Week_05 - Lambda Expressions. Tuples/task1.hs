{-
Define a function that:

- accepts a function and returns a unary
lambda that applies that function to its argument;
- accepts a predicate and returns a unary
lambda that applies the
negated predicate to its argument;
- accepts two functions and returns their composition over an argument;
- returns a function that is the partial application of `f` over `x`;
- `(\ x y z -> x y z) (\ x y -> x + y) 5 6` <- What will the output be?

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. All tests pass.
2. Typeclasses are used.

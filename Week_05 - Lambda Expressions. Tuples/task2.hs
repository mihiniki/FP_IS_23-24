{-
Define a function that accepts an unary function - `f`,
and returns a lambda of two real numbers - `x`, `y`,
and subtracts `f(x)` from `f(y)`.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. All tests pass.
2. Initially use `Double`, but then transition to all number types.
3. The solution is written on a single line of code.
